In this blog post, I talk about bestiality, not because I’ve practised it or have any personal interest in it,but because I believe it’s important to bring up in order to make a point about moral consistency. If you don't like to think about bestiality then imagine that every time I mention it that I'm instead talking about kicking puppies.

## What being vegan means to me

I don’t contribute to the animal product industry, but that doesn't mean I can't consume animal products. For example, I’ll eat animal products to avoid food waste, finishing someone else’s meal, for instance, or use bones from a butcher if they’re given to me for free. Roadkill would also be acceptable in theory.

I can wear second-hand leather. I don’t go to the zoo. I don’t have pets, and if I ever did (or had children), I’d only provide them with vegan food. If you think that’s immoral, I understand where you're coming from. I haven’t researched whether a plant-based diet is sufficient for pets or children. I've decided to have neither children nor pets for now.

## Why I’m vegan

- I’m more than 50% certain that animals deserve moral consideration.
- I’m reasonably confident that future generations will look back on the animal industry like we now look back on the slave trade. Though I admit this is a weak argument, since future societies might be as well be aliens from our perspective.
- I try to live morally consistently. Lots of people are disgusted by the idea of eating a dog or cat, yet think nothing of eating calves, pigs, or birds. That’s inconsistent.
- Most people think raping an animal is immoral, but eating one is fine. That’s also inconsistent. You can argue that one correlates with sociopathy while the other doesn’t, but I’m not interested in reasons for why we should allow one but not the other, but instead in their moral value.
    - If you think both are acceptable, I respect your consistency even though we disagree.
    - If you think one is okay and the other isn't, I think you're being hypocritical.
- also Health and Environment reasons, but I want to explore moral reasoning here

## The “animals eat animals, so why can’t I?” argument

- Humans are capable of moral reasoning. Animals are not.
- This is an appeal to nature fallacy.
- Animals also have sex or rape other animals, should we consider that morally acceptable too?

## The "animals would kill use though" argument

- You're not an animal that kills to survive so comparing yourself to them or using them as ethical role models makes no sense.
- Livestock animals are herbivorous and are in Captivity, and represent no threat to you whatsoever.

## I'm not vegan can we still be friends?

Yes, most of my friends are not vegan and for lot's of them I'm the only exposure to vegan philosophy.

## I agree with you but I'm not vegan because

### I want to eat animal products

I know veganism is inconvenient, but I have more respect for people who realise that they're acting hypocritical than people who try to deny it. I hope that fake meat science will advance and anyone who wants to can eat ethical meat.

### I believe that my individual actions will have no effect

fair enough, similar to voting your individual actions don't have any effect but at the same time we as a society need to make sure that people don't believe that and go vote anyways. so if you're in this camp, do you vote in elections? if yes why?

## I disagree with you because

### some animals deserve some moral consideration some of the time

I have no respect for your opinion.

### animals deserve no moral consideration

Ok. I can empathise with this view point, it's possible that I'm wrong about having empathy for animals. But I wonder how with this view point the body of someone who is 100% confirmed brain dead forever qualifies for moral consideration, or even infants or the mentally handicapped. What if there was another enlightened Species?

## What about the people who would lose their job if everyone went vegan?

jobs have no inherent value, if they did we could just pay people to do things, like you could pay me 10€ per hour to just stand somewhere and do nothing and it would have created one new job. but no one pays me to stand somewhere so clearly jobs don't have inherent value, but instead people provide value to society through their jobs, if everyone who works in the animal industry loses their job then I hope we have socialist policies for them to fall back on, just like I would hope for people in any other industry.

## Problems I haven’t solved

What do vegans value?

- If it's _more life_, should I have as many children as possible?
- If it's _less suffering_, should I give away all my possessions and devote my life to doing good?

I haven’t figured these things out yet.

What moral consideration should I give to insects, fish, and creatures like mussels or shellfish? What about honey? Are free range eggs from a local farm fine, since they are by-products?

I have more research to do on these topics.

Also I think the word humane slaughter is a misnomer, humane would be the absence of slaughter.

If you have something to say, something you want me to add, or something you want to argue about then email my at veganism [at] hilll [dot] dev 

There are more conclusion and parallels to be drawn here, particularly to natalism, AI CSAM and abortion, I will write about those topics in the future.
