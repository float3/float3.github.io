People who stray from the norms often claim to be using their free will. This is strange. Why is the philosophical idea that we **have** free will taken for granted by most of society? I find it incomprehensible and incompatible with reality.

## Where Do Our Choices Come From?

Zoom in on a single decision: you reach for tea. Neurons fire; muscles move. Where did that firing pattern originate? Here's a causal stack:

* **Genetics & developmental wiring**: Baseline neurotransmitter systems; temperament biases; neural architecture.
* **Early environment**: Prenatal conditions, nutrition, attachment, language exposure.
* **Learning history**: Reinforcement, punishment, imitation; the statistical structure of experiences that tuned synaptic weights.
* **Current internal state**: Hormones, circadian phase, glucose, stress load, fatigue.
* **Current perceptual input**: Smell of tea, sight of mug, social cues.
* **Learned decision policies**: Habit loops, value estimates, predictive models.
* **Noise / chaotic dynamics**: Thermal noise, stochastic synaptic release, network‑level chaos.

There's no "you" in this stack, there's no soul.

Some argue that quantum indeterminacy rescues freedom. But randomness ≠ authorship. If a you are randomly influenced by the laws of physics I would find it a difficult claim to say that that is you.

## A Quick Test

If you had deep, contra‑causal free will, you should be able to reconfigure yourself by raw act of will-no training loop, no exposure therapy, just deciding.

**Example 1: Taste aversion**

1. Identify a food you strongly dislike (say, black olives).
2. Decide-really, *will* it-that you now want to want olives.
3. Check: do you in fact desire olives? Did the felt aversion flip?

**Example 2: Motivation**

1. Notice: *I don't want to run a marathon next month.*
2. Try-pure willpower-to become the kind of person who wants to run that marathon.
3. Recheck the motivation. Still not there? Same problem.

These tests fail. Higher‑order desires ("I wish I wanted X") do not translate to lower‑order desires ("I actually want X").

Yes, you *can* sometimes reshape tastes and motives-but via conditioning, repeated exposure, social incentives, dopaminergic updates, etc.
